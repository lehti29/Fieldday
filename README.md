## Run in browser
cordova requirements says that it doesn't have browser, but that is false for me. Just open it anyway (if something pops up to install your default browser, you can ignore it. just open the address anyway).
"cordova build browser && cordova run browser"

## Install stuff
install cordova using "npm install -g cordova"

Check requirements using "cordova requirements"

### OSX
#### Android dev tools
Download dev-tools from [developer-android](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), they are at the bottom unless you want entire android studio.

#### IOS
Install XCode from AppStore. Install the deploy-thing with command "npm install -g ios-deploy".
export ANDROID_HOME=/usr/local/share/android-sdk

#### Cocoapods
"brew install cocoapods"

"pod setup"
