# TODO list

1 & 2 is very important.

3 & 4 is a little less important, but still holds prio. The rest comes naturally when we are done.

1. Databases
    * Users with: ~~username, password, id, list of groups,~~ images
    * Groups with: group id, list of users
    * ~~Coords have for each user, their coordinate. So lat, lng and user id.~~
2. Login(/logout). ~~Really only login needed. Could be hard coded right now to auto login a specific user.~~
3. ~~Update coords every X time.~~ Maybe longer X (now 3 sec)
4. Session.
    * ~~Handle current user, which groups to view~~
    * remove all hardcoded variables related to user. Like, sharepos userid, sidebar stuff.
5. ~~Checkboxes update~~
    * ~~switching active checkboxes updates who to view.~~
6. Markers styling



## Bonus extra
1. Stop tracking of person
